Often, they cannot understand why this is so, particularly if they have ensured that they live within their means, don&rsquo;t have too much debt and pay the full amount due on their accounts in full and on time every month.</span> </p> <p> <span> Although the decision whether or not to grant credit does not lie with the credit bureau which compiles the credit report, this report is used by credit providers &ndash; banks, retail stores, cellphone companies and so on - when a consumer applies for credit or to open an account.</span> </p> <p> <span> The credit provider uses the information in the credit report to score the applicant&rsquo;s creditworthiness and decide, based on their own criteria, whether or not to grant the credit applied for, or whether to grant a lesser amount &ndash; and at what interest rate.</span> </p> <p> <span> Regular examination of one&rsquo;s credit report will enable consumers to check that all the information in it is accurate. Sometimes there could be errors or areas of dispute. For example, there were 22 822 disputes lodged about information held on consumer credit records for the quarter ended December 2014.</span> </p> <p> <span> These disputes may have been no more serious that an error in name or address; but some could well have involved a far more serious issue such as inaccurate reflection of payments made.</span> </p> <p> <span> A regular examination of one&rsquo;s credit report could also provide timely warning to consumers that they might have been the victim of identity theft with the identity thieves running up enormous debt in their name.</span> </p> <p> <span> Anyone who obtains their free credit report and has concerns about possible errors or discrepancies can contact the credit bureau that issued the report and lodge a dispute.</span> </p> <p> <span> They should then provide the credit bureau with as much supporting documentation as possible &ndash; receipts or other evidence of payment. The bureau will investigate and respond to the consumer with the outcome within 21 working days.</span> </p> <p> <span> Anyone can obtain their free TransUnion report directly from TransUnion</span> </p> </span> <span> </span> <span> Share This Page</span> Product Highlights: <p> An updated/ once off view of your TransUnion Credit Report.</p> <p> Check your details to ensure that the information is accurate.</p> <p> Displays any adverse court action taken against you.</p> <span> About Us</span> <span> Free Credit Report</span> <span> About TransUnion</span> <span> Corporate social responsibility</span> <span> Newsroom</span> <span> Careers</span> <span> Diversity and inclusion</span> <span> Contact us</span> <span> Client Support</span> <span> Support for Business</span> <span> FAQs</span> <span> Information for</span> <span> Channel Partners</span> Contact Us Have questions?
