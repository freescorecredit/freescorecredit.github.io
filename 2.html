It is the numerical representation of their creditworthiness. A credit score is a 3-digit number that falls in the range of 300-900, 900 being the highest.</p> <p> Credit scores are calculated by the credit bureaus in the country after taking into consideration several factors like the length of your credit history, repayment records, credit inquiries, among others.</p> <p> When you apply for a credit card or a loan from a bank of NBFCs, having a higher credit score may entitle you to receive further benefits such as a higher loan amount, lower interest rate and your choice of tenure to repay the loan.</p> <h2> Steps To Get Your Free Credit Score</h2> Visit credit score Page Enter your first and last name. Add your mobile number and e-mail ID. An OTP will be sent to your mobile number for verification. The next step would be to verify your age. Your credit score and your report will be then displayed on the screen. <h2> Credit Score Range and What It Means</h2> <p> A credit score in India ranges between 300-900. You should always take measure to bring your credit score closer to 900. A higher credit score increases your chances of getting a good deal on loans as well as credit cards .</p> CIBIL Score Range Meaning NA/NH This means it is either “not applicable” or no history”. If you have not used a credit card or have never taken a loan, you will have no credit history. 350 – 549 A CIBIL score in this range is considered as a bad CIBIL score. It means you have been late in paying credit card bills or EMIs for loans. With a CIBIL score in this range, it will be difficult for you to get a loan or a credit card as you are at a high-risk of turning into a defaulter. 550 – 649 A CIBIL score in this range is considered as fair. It suggests you have been struggling to pay the dues on time. The interest rates on the loan could also be higher. 650 – 749 If your CIBIL score is in this range, you are on the right path. You should continue displaying good credit behaviour and increase your score further. Lenders will consider your credit application and offer you a loan. However, you may still not have the negotiation power to get the best deal on the rate of interest for loan. 750 – 900 This is an excellent CIBIL score. It suggests you have been regular with credit payments and have an impressive payment history. Banks will offer you loans and credit cards as well considering you are at the lowest risk of turning into a defaulter. <h2> CIBIL Score Range</h2> <p> The CIBIL score (a 3-digit number) gives a summary of the credit history from several details on the Credit Report such as ‘Enquiries’ and ‘Accounts’. The CIBIL score ranges between 300 and 900. The higher the CIBIL score, the easier it is to get a loan or a credit card approved. Making late payments and multiple enquiries will lead to the CIBIL score reducing. Any score of 750 and above is considered as ideal and you will qualify for various credit cards and loans. In case your credit score is less than 750, you will find it difficult to avail a loan from NBFC and banks.</p> <p> In case the loan is approved, the interest rates will be high if the CIBIL score is close to 750. Banks and NBFCs will reject the application if the credit score is low. The four important sections of the credit report are Credit Enquiries, Public Records, Account History, and Credit Summary. The various factors that are considered by CIBIL when they compute the credit score are the credit mix, new credits, tenure, credit utilisation, credit balance, and repayment history.</p> <h2> Experian Score Range</h2> <p> The Experian score ranges between 300 and 850. A credit score in India of 800 and above is considered excellent. A good credit score is anything above 700. The higher the credit score, the more confident banks and NBFCs are that you will be able to repay the loan. Most credit scores range between 600 and 750. Various lenders such as NBFCs and banks provide loans and credit cards based on the credit score. Approval of car loans also depends on your credit score. The better the credit score, the down payment and the interest rates will be low.</p> <p> Credit scores ranging from 300 to 579, 580 to 669, 670 to 739, 740 to 799, and 800 to 850 are considered to be very poor, fair, good, very good, and excellent. The credit score depends on several factors such as derogatory information, recent credit applications, credit history, credit history length, credit utilisation, and payment history. Some of the factors that do not influence the credit score are details not available in the credit report, child support payments, where you stay, your income, your employment, and your age. Paying all your bills on time and not making several enquiries will ensure that your credit score does not drop.</p> <h2> Who Computes Credit Score?</h2> <p> Your Credit Score is computed by <p> When you make a transaction—the one that is relevant to determine your score—banks send details about it to all four credit bureaus. To send details to all credit agencies is a mandate by the RBI. Essentially, banks keep Credit Information Companies up-to-date about your monetary habits. If a bank needs to check online credit score, they can approach any one of the bureaus. It doesn’t matter which one because all will have the same score for you– all four are equally authoritative and on par with each other.</p> <p> After receiving information from the bank, credit bureaus get down to the task of collecting more information about your financial habits from other banks and financial institutions. The credit bureaus then processes this information to formulate what is called a <strong> Credit Report</strong> .</p> <h2> Why Should I check my Credit Score?</h2> <p> It is very important that you keep a close eye on your Credit Score. It is the best way to gauge your chances to get a line of credit. Another reason why you should track your score is to know if it dips, or if an error has been made by credit agencies while calculating your score. This will help you make timely amends. </p> <h2> Why is BankBazaar Giving me my Credit Score for Free?</h2> <p> BankBazaar feels that you should always be in complete command of your personal finances. In order to help you with this goal, we have made provisions for you to check credit score free. Knowing your Credit Score before applying for a loan can help greatly. </p> <p> If you have a good score, you can be rest assured that your loan or Credit Card application will be processed without any hassle. You can even leverage a good score to ask your lender bank for better rates of interest and additional benefits. On the other hand, seeking credit with a poor score will further lower your score. Let’s not even imagine getting approval for a credit line. Hence, check your Credit Score online before you apply for a financial product. Work up the score if it’s not in the acceptable range.</p> <p> <strong> TIP:</strong> Credit agencies review and renew your score every few months. If you have a poor Credit Score, start managing your money wisely and pay your dues on time for a few months. Credit agencies will reward you by boosting your score.</p> <h2> Does my Credit Score Get Impacted if I Enquire About it?</h2> <p> It depends on the kind of enquiry being made. There are two types of enquiries – hard and soft enquiry. Hard enquiries send your Credit Score down by a few points, while soft enquiries <strong> do not</strong> impact your Credit Score. </p> <p> An enquiry made by an individual is called a soft enquiry. BankBazaar will make a soft enquiry on your behalf when getting your Credit Score from Experian. Hence, this will not impact your Credit Score in any manner. Moreover, you can get your free credit score.</p> <p> A hard enquiry is when a financial institution checks your Credit Score to take a decision on your credit application. Every time you apply for a loan or a Credit Card, the lending institution checks your score. Each time a bank checks your score, your score will dip by a few points. </p> <p> <strong> TIP:</strong> If you are applying for a loan or a Credit Card, do not apply to many banks at the same time. Too many enquiries will hurt your Credit Score. </p> <h2> What Hurts your Credit Score?</h2> <p> It is understood that having high balances on your credit card can significantly reduce your credit score. Apart from that, there are several other factors that can hurt your credit score:</p> Being late on your credit payments. Completely ignoring your loan dues/credit card bills. Creditors charge off accounts when credit card bills are not paid on time. The status of having your account charged off is one of the worst incidents that reflects on your credit score. Lenders use third-party debt collectors to retrieve the loan amount from you, in case they do not receive payments. Having your account sent to collections reflects very poorly on your credit score. Filing for bankruptcy can have a devastating effect on your credit score. When you request to close a credit card that has an outstanding balance, your credit limit drops to Rs.0. This is similar to a situation where you have maxed out your credit card. Closing old credit cards shortens your credit history. This has a negative impact on your credit score. Applying for multiple credit cards or loans within a short duration makes your credit score plunge. Hence, it is advisable to limit the number of applications. Having only one type of credit account will negatively impact your credit score. So, you should look to maintain a mix of loans and credit card debts and make consistent payments on time. If you fail to check your credit report occasionally and fix errors, if any, your credit score can be hurt. It should be understood that credit reporting bureaus also make mistakes while creating credit reports. If you do not monitor and correct your report, it may cost you a lot in the future. <h2> Calculation of Credit Score</h2> <p> Credit bureaus in the country compute credit scores after taking into consideration several factors such as your credit history, repayment behaviour, and credit type, among others. There are four credit bureaus in the country - TransUnion CIBIL, Experian, Equifax, and CRIF High Mark. They are licensed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The financial institutions in the country send your credit details on a monthly basis to these bureaus. Each credit bureau has its own algorithm and method of calculating scores.</p> <p> Let’s take a look at the four main factors and their impact on your credit score:</p> <strong> Payment History (High Impact)</strong> If you are not able to pay credit card bills and EMIs on time, it will have the highest impact on your score. <strong> Credit Exposure (High Impact)</strong> It is advised to avoid delayed payments as well as missed payments, as they get reported and affect your score in a negative way. <strong> Age of the Credit (Medium Impact)</strong> A long credit history works well for your credit score as it gives the lender an insight of your repayment patterns over time. <strong> Total Types of Account (Low Impact)</strong> It is better to have a good balance of secured as well as unsecured loans in your credit history. <h2> Benefits of a good Credit Score:</h2> <p> If you have a good Credit Score, you can avail loans and Credit Cards faster and with ease. Check yours now!</p> <p> <strong> Get The Best Credit Card - </strong> A good Credit Score may get you the best of Credit Cards. Get a feature-loaded card and reap the benefits. </p> <p> <strong> Quick Loan Approval - </strong> A good Credit Score works like an expressway for your loan application. Banks may approve your application quickly and readily. </p> <p> <strong> Better Interest Rate - </strong> With the backing of a good Credit Score, you can bargain for a lower rate of interest on loans and Credit Cards. </p> <p> <strong> Loans Made More Affordable - </strong> Loans come saddled with processing fees and many other charges. You can bargain your way out of some of these charges with a good Credit Score. </p> <p> Check your Credit Score right away and see if you are eligible for all these benefits. You can check your score on BankBazaar at zero cost. </p> <h3> Credit Score/Credit Report</h3> <p> How to Improve Credit Score </p> <p> How to Monitor Credit Score </p> <p> What is Considered a Bad Credit Score </p> <p> Know about Credit Score and How is it Calculated? </p> <p> How to Read a Credit Report </p> <p> What is CRIF High Mark? </p> <p> Reasons Why You Must Check the Credit Report </p> <h2> Will Checking Your CIBIL Report Repeatedly Hamper Your Score</h2> <p> Many people worry that if they make frequent credit report inquiries or check their credit report, it will negatively affect their credit score. The inquiries are actually made by financial institutions and banks when you apply for a new credit. This is known as ‘hard inquiries’. Requesting them to make numerous hard inquiries within a short span of time, might negatively impact your credit score. Banks and financial institutions frequently checking and enquiring about your CIBIL report may suggest an increase in your debt or might even show you as a credit-hungry person.</p> <p> If you make a soft inquiry (checking your own credit report), will not affect your credit score. When you check your own credit report, it shows that you are responsible and are keeping track of any errors in your report, and trying to correct them. Make sure to check your credit score often to keep track of any mistakes that could arise. You can always get a free credit score from the CIBIL website.</p> <h2> Why Do Lenders Check Your CIBIL Score Before Approving Your Loan</h2> <p> CIBIL Score is a 3-digit numeric value. This figure reflects your credit worthiness. The score is determined by using the information in your ‘Accounts’ and ‘Enquiries’ sections. These will be found on your CIBIL report. The CIBIL score ranges from 300 to 900.</p> <p> A score closer to 900 is a very good score. Lenders will look into your credit score to see how credit worthy you are. The closer your credit score is to 900, the higher are the chances that the lender will approve your loan application. A high credit score reflects a high credit history and shows the lender that you are capable of repaying the loan.</p> <h2> <span> </span> 4 Credit Score secrets </h2> <p> Credit Score is one of the most misunderstood topics in the financial book. Here are four secrets to help you understand your Credit Score better.</p> <strong> Credit Score and Credit Report</strong> <p> Your Credit Score is calculated based on information present in your credit report. Your credit report presents details about your credit accounts, credit application and debt repayment, among others.</p> <strong> Checking Your Score Will Not Hurt It</strong> <p> When you or a company enquires about your Credit Score, it’s called a soft enquiry and it <strong> does not</strong> hurt your credit score. </p> <strong> Credit Score Math</strong> <p> There are five prime factors that go towards deciding your Credit Score. They are - debt repayment, credit utilisation ratio, average credit age, type of credit account (secured / unsecured) and Credit Score enquiries made. </p> <strong> Keep an Eye On Fraud</strong> <p> You did nothing wrong and yet your Credit Score is low? Please go through your Credit Report thoroughly and immediately report any unauthorised activities to your bank to correct your score.</p> <p> Before you plan to get an application approved keep a track of your credit score on regular basis either by taking free CIBIL score or subscription based CIBIL score. Scores normally range from 300-850. </p> <h2> <span> </span> Healthy Credit Score Crucial in 2020 </h2> <p> Given the interest rates edging up this year, maintaining a healthy credit score is vital. Credit score directly influences whether you will be eligible for a loan and how much interest you will be paying back. Higher the credit score, lower is the interest rate and the vice versa. Any lender before approving a loan application or credit card application analyses multiple factors and one of the major aspects is checking the credit score that can drastically drop the chances of the loan getting rejected. </p> <p> If the lender assumes you as risk borrower even though they will approve your application, but the chances are high that the interest rates will be tremendously high. So, before you plan to get an application approved keep a track of your credit score on regular basis either by taking free CIBIL score or subscription based CIBIL score. Scores normally range from 300-850. While above 750 is considered as a good credit score and can get your application approved in lower interest rate, scores below 750 shows your defaults that can increase your interest amount. If your score is below 550 chances are high that you loan application may get rejected. So, track your credit score for free from the various credit bureaus.</p> <strong> What is a Free Experian Credit Score?</strong> <h2> List of Credit Information Companies in India:</h2> <strong> TransUnion CIBIL Limited: </strong> (earlier known as - Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited) is the first Credit Information Company (CIC) of India that was founded in August 2000.

These include mortgages, credit card accounts, student loans, and inquiries on your credit history. A credit score is similar to a grade that is provided to your credit report. It is a 3-digit number that usually ranges from 300 to 900. The credit report is a reflection of your credit management, and you have control over the listings there. The credit reporting bureau assigns you the credit score based on your credit history. The credit report gives an outline on how much you owe your creditors over an extended period of time, whether you have been making payments consistently, and for how long each account was open. The report also lists associated public records against you, such as court judgements, bankruptcy filings, etc. A high credit score indicates that you are a low risk borrower, making you more likely to qualify for a loan. In order to access your credit report, you can get in touch with credit reporting agencies or use a credit monitoring service that offers you this information. Your credit score is a part of the exhaustive credit report that you receive from the credit bureau. <h2> Importance of Credit Reports for Companies and Businesses </h2> <p> Similar to individual credit reports, the CICs prepare credit reports and assign credit ratings to businesses and all other types of firms. The credit report for businesses is closely reviewed by suppliers and government agencies while providing utility and business contracts.</p> <p> The credit reports for businesses provide information related to the establishment, owners/directors, employees, profit and loss, liability, assets, pending court cases (if any), and various other details. These type of credit reports can be expensive based on the amount and type of information it offers.</p> <h2> Understanding the Credit Reports through key terms</h2> <p> <strong> NA or NH:</strong> If you never owned a credit card or took a loan, there are chances that you will see an NA or NH on your credit score. NA or NH indicates that are there no, little, or insufficient credit activity to create a report or to generate a online credit score. </p> <p> <strong> STD:</strong> Applicable to an individual's credit report where the payments are made with the due dates. </p> <p> <strong> SMA:</strong> Applicable on a credit report when the borrower has delayed the repayments. </p> <p> <strong> DBT:</strong> This indicates a doubtful situation where the credit information has been inactive for over 12 months. </p> <p> <strong> LSS:</strong> A credit report can be remarked as LSS if a lender reported the loan/credit card account as loss or if the account remains as a defaulter for a longer period of time. </p> <p> <strong> DPD:</strong> Days past due (DPD) indicates the number of days that the account has not received a payment. <strong> Written Off/Settled Status: </strong> In a situation where the borrower could not make the repayment but came to an agreement with the lender for either a repayment plan or a settlement will indicate a written off or settle status. </p> <h2> Reading a Credit Report</h2> <p> A credit report is a detailed account of a person’s credit history. The credit report will include details of your credit accounts, like, credit cards, auto loans, home loans and any other form of credit availed from a registered lender. The credit report will also include details like payment history, credit limit and account balance, opening date of credit, status of loans (close or open, paid in full, not paid in full). The report will also include new credit inquiries, collection records and public records, for cases in which an individual has filed for bankruptcy or a tax lien. A credit report can seem like quite an intimidating document to read, but listed below is a section-wise breakdown of how a person should read his/her credit report:</p> <p> <strong> Personal Information: </strong> This section of the credit report will contain information pertaining to the individual’s identity, such as, the person’s name, address, current and previous accounts, date of birth, etc. An individual should check the details provided under this section, if there is an incorrect address in the report or the person’s name has been misspelled, he/she should report this to the Credit Rating Agency (CRA) as this could be a sign of wrong data being reflected in the report or credit fraud. </p> <p> <strong> Account Information: </strong> This section of the credit report will carry information pertaining to the person’s present and past credit account. The individual should check the details of this section carefully as this is quite a detailed section. The following details should be checked: </p> Date of opening Name of creditor Current balance Highest balance/credit limit Monthly payment history Account type (Instalment, revolving, open) Account ownership (Individual or joint) Payment status <p> <strong> Public Records: </strong> This section of the Credit Report will list and bankruptcies filed by the individual, tax liens availed by the individual or collection accounts. The dates provided in this section should be checked as they will directly affect how long they will appear on an individual’s credit report and affect the person’s credit score. </p> <p> <strong> Inquiries: </strong> This section carries data pertaining to any inquiries made by companies regarding an individual’s credit score. If an individual applies for multiple lines of credit, this could affect his/her score negatively. In most cases inquiries do not affect a person’s credit score, as they are soft inquiries by lenders for promotional purposes. A soft inquiry is generated when the request for the credit report is not related to the individual’s request for credit. </p> <h2> <span> </span> T.I.P.S. to get a great Credit Score </h2> <p> A great Credit Score is anything above 800. If a bad Credit Score is the bane of your life, you can use the following tips to send it soaring. Want to know your score?</p> <strong> Be Frugal</strong> <p> Keep your credit utilisation ratio at 30% for a good Credit Score. If you are struggling to stay within this limit, then get a card with a higher top limit.</p> <strong> Seek Variety</strong> <p> A combination of secured and unsecured debt will send your Credit Score upwards. A Credit Card is an unsecured debt whereas a Car Loan is a secured debt.</p> <strong> Advantage of Old Credit Card Accounts</strong> <p> Think twice before you close an old Credit Card account as long running accounts add more value to your Credit Score. And if you are not using your card, keep it safe to prevent misuse or fraud.</p> <h2> <span> </span> 5 Credit Score myths that you should be aware of </h2> <p> Listed below are some of the most common myths about credit that you should know:</p> <strong> You will not receive credit if you do not already have it</strong> <p> When you approach a lender for a loan, four elements of your credit report are analysed:</p> Account history Identification Inquiries Public records, such as court records or bankruptcy filings <p> If there is no established credit history for you, you just have to get someone to co-sign or authorise your loan. In case you do not have any one who can co-sign for you, you can explore the option of getting a secured credit card. This type of card requires you to put up cash as collateral. Once you start using the credit card, you will be able to establish a credit history. It is important that you make payments on time and use credit conservatively. Be patient, as it will certainly take time to build a credit history. Once your credit history is periodically evaluated, if you have a good standing, your credit score will increase.</p> <strong> Checking your credit report will negatively impact your score</strong> <p> If an individual accesses his/her own credit report, it will not have a negative impact on the score. In fact, it is a healthy practice to check your credit report at least on an annual basis. Reviewing a report results in a “soft inquiry” that will only be reflected in a personal credit report. When a lender reviews the credit report, a “hard enquiry” will be added. These hard enquiries are shown to other lenders who review the report in the future, as these may represent new debts that are not yet visible on the credit report. Too many hard enquiries can have a negative effect on your credit score. </p> <strong> Once your credit score is bad, it is not possible to rebuild it</strong> <p> A bad credit report can be rebuilt over time. The report shows all credit issued under the consumer’s name. It also shows all items that are closed or inactive. If you have missed payments or have made late payments, it can remain on your credit report for up to 7 years. In this time, you can rebuild your credit report by paying your dues on time, looking for better credit choices, and being judicious while spending. You have to remember that an old negative information in the report is less important than a recent positive one.</p> <strong> The government owns credit reporting agencies</strong> <p> Credit bureaus are not owned by the government. However, the government has laid down many laws on how these should operate.</p> <strong> Paying in cash always helps to improve credit rating</strong> <p> Using cash for all payments is certainly not better than using credit responsibly. This is because a consumer has to develop a credit history (displaying responsible credit usage) in order to establish a good credit score. If a consumer does not hold various types of credit accounts, his/her credit score will not be as good as another individual with a history of responsible credit usage.</p> <h2> FAQs on Credit Score/ Credit Report</h2> <strong> Why is PAN card required for checking the credit score?</strong> <p> The PAN card is required for obtaining the individual’s score accurately. The credit score can also be obtained by using other valid Proof of Identity (PoI) instead of the PAN card. The PoI helps in identifying individuals in the database.</p> <strong> Can credit score inquiries affect the score?</strong> <p> No, the inquiry will not affect your credit score.

Your credit report will already have your phone number, when you provide your phone number, it is verified against your records to ensure you are the right recipient for your credit score.</p> <strong> Is there a limit to request for accessing credit score?</strong> <p> There are no limits to the inquiry of credit score. You can check for your credit score as many times as you need to.

For example, when you are applying for a credit card or loan, making payments towards the credit, it will impact your credit report and the score. </p> <strong> What is the significance of credit score range?</strong> <p> The credit score range can vary depending on the assessor, however, the value will represent the same level of creditworthiness. The credit score summary will also indicate the health status, it will tell you if a particular score is excellent, good, average, or poor.</p> <strong> What can be considered as a good credit score?</strong> <p> Credit score may vary based on the credit rating company. The credit report and score will provide you with an indication of whether you have a good or bad score. A good score with a particular assessor will more likely to have a good score with another assessor.</p> <strong> What are the factors that are included in the calculation of credit score?</strong> <p> There are few factors that are considered while calculating an individual’s credit score. Primarily, the account information that includes information of credit cards and loans, the public records containing information pertaining to tax lien and bankruptcy, and the hard inquiries made by your lenders will be accountable for the calculation of credit score.</p> <strong> Will the credit score be affected for owning multiple credit cards?</strong> <p> This will depend on your credit history. If you have multiple credit cards with a higher limit and you are under-utilizing or over-utilizing it, this can impact your credit score negatively.</p> <strong> What type of information is included in my credit report?</strong> <p> The following information will be included in your credit card report:</p> Individual’s name, address, and other personal details PAN card and contact number Credit history Credit cards/loans Payment patterns Lender’s inquiry details, and more <strong> What kind of information is not included in the credit report?</strong> <p> A credit report won’t contain any information related to your checking or savings accounts. Also, the information pertaining to criminal records, medical history, lifestyle, and other details are not included in the credit report.</p> <strong> How long does the information remain on a credit report?</strong> <p> This will depend on various factors such as the inclusion of hard inquires, payment details, credit card, and loan applications. As soon any changes are detected, your credit report would change. The information is obtained on a monthly basis for the changes to be implemented. If you find any error on your credit report, you are recommended to get it corrected from the assessor.</p> <strong> Is it possible to delete information from the credit report?</strong> <p> Unless it is incorrect, no details can be deleted from your credit report. The credit report provides an insight of your credit history and lending worthiness. Most lenders vastly depend on the credit reports to assess the lending risks.</p> <strong> What do I need to do to if I find errors on my credit report?</strong> <p> If you notice any error or wrong entries in your credit report, you can get in touch with the credit report provided to get it rectified.

The CIBIL score is derived from the information available in the Credit Information Report.</p> <strong> Who can access my credit report?</strong> <p> Your credit report can be accessed by you, lenders, and government recognized regulating bodies.</p> <strong> Why do lenders check the Credit Score?</strong> <p> The lenders refer to the credit score to determine the credit worthiness of individuals.

A facility for moratorium was offered for 6 months, which ended in August 2020, after which the facility for loan restructuring was offered. However, while the apex bank has permitted banks to maintain restructured loans in the ‘'standard’' category in their loan books in order to lower their Non Performing Assets (NPA), lenders have to report all such loans to credit bureaus as having been ‘'restructured’'. This is very likely to negatively impact the credit scores of such borrowers and subsequently affect their eligiblity for loans in future as well. If an individual has more than one loan and has applied for restructuring for just one loan, the remaining loans will also be reported under the ‘'restructured’' category to the credit bureaus. This is why it is important to pay EMIs regularly if the loan restructuring option has been chosen. Credit utilisation should also not exceed 40% and fresh loans should be avoided so as not to further bring down the credit score. There is also a fee to be paid by borrowers to avail the restructuring option. Some banks, such as State Bank of India, are also increasing the interest rate on restructured loans. The amount of interest that is lost during the period of restructuring by the lender is also added to the principal amount which will further increase the overall interest component of the loan.</p> <p> </p> <p> 20 October 2020 </p> <h3> Loan restructuring may affect credit score and eligibility</h3> <p> The Reserve Bank of India’s had permitted financial institutions to provide a loan restructuring scheme to borrowers of loans in order to help mitigate financial challenges in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. This would help borrowers to pay off their Equated Monthly Instalments (EMIs) in a way that was more feasible and affordable to them.</p> <p> The loan restructuring was a one-time measure after the end of the 6-month moratorium that was offered from March to August 2020. The RBI has allowed financial institutions to report these loans to credit bureaus as ‘'restructured’' while maintaining them as ‘'standard’' in their own loan books. This was meant to help lenders to lower their Non Performing Assets (NPAs). However, restructured loans often have a negative impact on the credit scores of borrowers. This usually affects the eligibility when applying for future loans as well.</p> <p> However, it is not yet clear how this restructuring will affect the credit scores of borrowers. Restructured loans may also have higher interest rates, which will depend on the lender. The interest lost by the lender during the period of restructuring of the loan may also be added to the principal amount, which will further increase the outgo of interest for the borrowers.</p> <p> </p> <p> 6 October 2020 </p> <h3> Credit scores slashed despite RBI instructions to not take such steps </h3> <p> Credit information companies have slashed the credit scores of borrowers to availed moratorium on loan repayments. The development comes to light after aggrieved borrowers complained of it on Twitter. It must be noted here that credit scores are used to judge the creditworthiness of borrowers and are essential for getting loans. It is normal practice for credit bureaus to alter credit scores in case of defaults or delays as reported by lenders.</p> <p> The country’s central bank had specifically stated on 27 March that rescheduling of repayments including interest will not qualify as default for the purposes of supervisory reporting and reporting to credit information companies (CICs) by the lending institutions. Experts, however believe that credit scores are not entirely based on delays reported by lenders as credit information bureaus also take into account extraneous factors.</p> <p> </p> <p> 8 September 2020 </p> <h3> CSC partners with TransUnion to provide CIBIL score</h3> <p> The Common Service Centre (CSC) has partnered with TransUnion CIBIL Ltd. to provide the CIBIL score. The new partnership will provide access to individuals in rural areas, where over 2.5 lakh CSCs are present. CSCs allow individuals to avail bank loans quickly for their personal and entrepreneurial needs. Lenders access the CIBIL score to check the individual’s financial health and credit worthiness. Lenders use this data before loans are provided. Individuals will have to go through the authentication process in order to get the CIBIL score via CSCs. The report can also be downloaded. According to the Chief Executive Officer of the CSC, Dinesh Tyagi, individuals in rural areas lack awareness about the CIBIL score. Customers who have a good credit score can negotiate for better interest rates.</p> <p> </p> <p> 14 July 2020 </p> <h3> India’s cut in credit rating </h3> <p> India’s credit rating has moved one step closer to junk after Moody’s Investors Service had downgraded the country to a low investment grade level and had also surprised the economists.</p> <p> Moody’s had reduced the long-term foreign-currency credit rating to Baa3 from Baa2, and this implies that it can get cut further. This action brings it in par with the BBB- assessment from Fitch Ratings Ltd and S&amp;P Global Ratings. The economy is now facing a huge contraction in over four decades.</p> <p> </p> <p> 4 June 2020 </p> <h3> RBI rate cut followed by increased credit growth by 100 bps</h3> <p> The credit growth of all commercial banks had grown around 7% on 10 April to Rs.102.85 trillion. This was the data that had been gathered from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). On 27 March, the RBI had reduced the repo rate by 75 bps for stimulating growth, after which the banks also lowered their deposit rates and lending rates.</p> <p> This is an improvement from the 6% credit growth that had been seen in the previous fortnight ended 27 March. Credit growth has been reducing for the past few quarters and has been expected to reduce further because of the coronavirus that has disrupted all credit disbursals. The lenders from the public sector are now trying their best to push the covid-19 emergency credit lines to all their borrowers. It had been reported n 26 April that all branch-level officials in public sector banks are now having difficulty in managing the superiors’ expectations on higher credit growth. In a few cases, the branch officials have also learned that the demand for fresh credit has reduced drastically and this has brought almost all loan disbursals to a standstill.</p> <p> Care Ratings had said that the credit growth in the banking sector has remained moderate since September 2019 after it had recorded a double-digit growth by the end of the quarter June 2018. The RBI data says that the bank deposits have increased during the 10 April fortnight, as compared to the 27 March fortnight. The deposits had grown at 9.45% y-o-y during the 10 April fortnight, and it had been growing at 7.93% during the previous fortnight.</p> <p> </p> <p> 28 April 2020 </p> <h3> CRISIL revises credit rating of BASF India</h3> <p> CRISIL has decided to put the rating of CRISIL AAA to the Non-Convertible Debentures of BASF India under rating watch with negative implications. The move to do so is been seen as an emerging situation which may affect the credit profile of BASF India. It must be noted here that the ratings on Fixed Deposits have been reaffirmed at ‘FAAA/Stable’ and that of Commercial paper at ‘CRISIL A1+’. CRISIL is a global analytical company providing ratings, research, and risk and policy advisory services.</p> <p> </p> <p> 9 April 2020 </p> <h3> Slowing credit growth poses challenge for Indian banks</h3> <p> Staggering credit growth is a huge challenge that the banking industry is now facing in India. The Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das had said that it is crucial that banks focus on prudent lending. The credit growth in India has moderated to 7-7.5%.</p> <p> He had added that the main challenge in India is a slow credit offtake and this, in turn, affects the profitability of all banks in the nation. In order to facilitate a faster flow of credit, the RBI has now taken a lot of steps. These include reduction in repo rate, provision of long-term repo operation and facilitation of bank refinance to NBFCs. These measures will help in boosting the operational efficiency of banks. The governor had said that the performance of a banking system lies on the strength of its corporate governance. He had added that the RBI can lay down a few rules and guidelines but eventually the responsibility lies on the banks.</p> <p> The RBI will be issuing the draft guidelines on corporate governance in the private and public sector banks. The governor had also added that the RBI's aim is to improve the efficiency of its regulatory and supervisory functions. While talking about NBFCs, he had said that credit flow to all small NBFCs has been increasing over the past year. A lot of aspects of top 50 NBFCs like the asset-liability management (ALM) position are now being assessed and monitored. This includes all NBFCs that have assets above Rs.5,000 crores.</p> <p> </p> <p> 24 March 2020 </p> <h3> India witnesses an increase in credit conscious women</h3> <p> Reports from credit bureau indicate that women are getting a lot more credit conscious as compared to men. Lenders now prefer to lend to women as there is a higher chance of them repaying loans.</p> <p> Between the age group of 36 and 50, the number of women borrowers have boosted by 33% since December 2017. A study by credit bureau Crif Highmark has revealed that the number of women borrowers over the age of 50 has increased 41%. A study by credit bureau Transunion Cibil shows that the self-monitoring rate among women has increased by 62%. This means that more women are frequently assessing their credit score and becoming more credit conscious.</p> <p> Around 56% of the self-monitoring women are from Tamil Nadu, Telengana, Karnataka, Delhi and Maharashtra. Sujata Ahlawat, VP and Head of Direct-to-Consumer Interactive, TransUnion Cibil had said that women have a better credit profile than male counterparts. This will, in turn, translate into wider access to credit and also faster and more efficient loan approvals</p> <p> </p> <p> 9 March 2020 </p> <h3> Bank credit growth falls 8.5% in January</h3> <p> According to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data, bank credit growth slumped by 8.5% for the month of January from 13.5% a year ago due to sharp slowdown in loans to the retail service sector. </p> <p> Growth in advances in the service sector fell from 23.9% to 8.9% in January 2020. However, personal loan segment during the month grew 16.9%, while credit to housing loan grew by 17.5% to 18.4%. Education loan during January declined by 3.1% in comparison to the negative decline of 2.3% in January 2019.

The credit report gives an excellent indication of my credit situation. The reports are updated with a lag. So, the exact credit situation is only reflected after a couple of months. Nevertheless, experience is good. The graphical representations are also good. Was this review helpful?
